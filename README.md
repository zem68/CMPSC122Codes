# CMPSC122Codes
In this repository, I have stored the codes from the CMPSC 122 course at Penn State. CMPSC 122, or Intermediate Programming in C++, is a course I took in my 2nd semester. Since then I have gone on to study more advanced concepts and techniques, including Object-Oriented Programming in Java, and System Programming in C in a UNIX/Linux environment.
