# CMPSC122Codes
In this repository, I have stored the codes I wrote in my CMPSC 122 course at Penn State.

CMPSC 122, or Intermediate Programming in C++, was a course I took in my 2nd semester. I am now heading into my junior year. In the courses I have taken since, I have studied more advanced concepts and techniques, including Object-Oriented Programming in Java, and System Programming in C in a UNIX/Linux environment.

All of the codes contain a short description at the top of the .cpp file in a comment.
